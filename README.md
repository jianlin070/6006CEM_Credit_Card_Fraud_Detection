# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This repository contains code for a Credit Card Fraud Detection project using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jianlin070/6006CEM_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.git
    cd 6006CEM_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can use the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Import Data:**

    Download the Credit Card Fraud dataset from Kaggle and place the CSV file (`creditcard.csv`) in the root directory of this project.

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks:**

    - Open Jupyter Notebook:

        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```

    - Navigate to the notebook (`Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb`) and run each cell to execute the code.

## Project Structure
